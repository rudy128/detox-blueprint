      <div className='w-2/3 my-10 text-2xl tracking-widest'>So you made it to the end,

        Do you think that living <strong>+10 years</strong> longer is worth it?

        Maybe the fact that you will have a brand <strong>new mind</strong> and <strong>unlimited will</strong>?

        For you the search has ended because you won't find anything better than this.

        Because to renew yourself like this takes self love.

        Trust me, you usually can’t buy time.

        <strong> But now you can…</strong>
